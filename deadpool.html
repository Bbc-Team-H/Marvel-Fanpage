            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Wade Wilson had always been rather mentally unstable. In his adulthood, he found himself wanting to be a
                hero by joining the military, but they turned him down because of his mental instability. And to make
                matters worse, Wade then discovered that he was diagnosed with lung cancer and was slowly dying. He
                broke up with his girlfriend to spare her from the burden of a man doomed to die, however it wasn't long
                before the Weapon X program came to him, offering not to cure his cancer, but to work around it to make
                him into the hero he always wanted to be. The program gave him a healing factor that negated his
                cancer... But also made him even more insane, and massively mutilated his face with rapidly-growing
                tumors. Because his healing factor made him nearly unkillable, the sadistic Dr. Killebrew used him for
                his experiments that would kill any normal human being. He escaped the Weapon X facilty and took up the
                mantle of the hero, Deadpool. Except... Whether or not he's a hero is pretty debatable.</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Howard and Maria Stark were billionaire weapon manufacturers who wanted to have a child. They tried to
                make one themselves, but due to problems Maria was facing the baby was doomed to die. To save the child,
                Howard desperately used his immense wealth to search across the world for a cure to the child's illness.
                In his travels he ended up saving an alien known as Rigellian Recorder 451. Recorder saw potential in
                Earth's future but also feared it would be crushed by other, more advanced races. To give Earth a
                fighting chance and thank Howard for his troubles, Recorder offered to genetically engineer the unborn
                baby for Howard and Maria to give him the intellectual power needed to bring the world to a new age of
                technology. Howard graciously accepted, and Arno Stark was born after a five month procedure.
                Unfortunately, Arno's health quickly degenerated to the point where he'd need medical help to survive
                for the rest of his life. Because his condition was so poor, Howard and Maria just decided to adopt the
                young Anthony Edward Stark.</p>
            <p>Tony grew up a rich man's childhood, without a care in the world and the greatest education. Tony's
                relationship with his father was rather strained, as he was abused and even forced to have his first
                alcoholic drink. Howard also forced into Tony his philosophies of war and how people have to clean up
                their own messes. At the age of 6, Tony began boarding school. Academics came easy to Tony, and he
                blitzed his way through school. When he was 15, he joined an MIT undergraduate program. By the time he
                was 17, Tony had already graduated with 3 PhDs under his belt. Life seemed peachy for young Tony, until
                the day tragedy struck.</p>
            <p>Howard and Maria were killed in a car crash orchestrated by one of Stark Industries' rivals, leaving Tony
                the heir of their fortune and company. Under his guidance, Stark Industries thrived. Tony lived for war,
                and loved his job of manufacturing weapons. He also lived a life of reckless partying and debauchery
                until the day he was in Pakistan demonstrating the power of his weapons. One managed to blow up in his
                face, leaving a piece of shrapnel piercing his chest and sinking towards his heart. While unconscious,
                Tony captured by the Ten Rings terrorist group in Pakistan. Held at gunpoint, the group forced the
                billionaire to engineer bombs for them and receive treatment for the shrapnel or be left to die. Being
                as clever as he is, Tony instead built a chest plate that would stop the shrapnel from killing him, then
                he built a mech suit around it. With his suit, he escaped the camp and dedicated his life to heroism.
                After returning from Pakistan, Tony spent his days fighting crime and eventually forming superhero
                groups like the Avengers.</p>

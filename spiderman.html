            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>After getting bit by a radioactive spider, 15-year-old Peter Parker discovered that he got super
                strength, speed, agility, and a spider-sense. After seeing an advertisement, he decided to test his
                powers on a wrestler. Peter easily defeated the wrestler and got the money he was promised. After that,
                Peter designed a device that can shoot webs, which he called "web-shooters" and a new costume. Peter,
                who now called himself Spider-Man, was an immediate hit. Once, after a show, he encountered a burglar.
                Instead of stopping him, Peter decided to let him go. The police officer that was chasing after him
                remanded Peter. However, he just says that it was not his problem.</p>
            <p>Later, he was heading home, he saw that his house was surrounded by police. When he asked a police
                officer, he was informed that his uncle Ben was killed by a burglar and that the burglar was currently
                being surround in a warehouse.</p>
            <p>Quickly donning his costume, Spider-Man went to the warehouse with revenge in his mind. When he caught
                the burglar, he looked at the burglar. He quickly realized that it was the same person he should have
                stopped. From that day on, Peter decided to use his powers to fight crime.</p>
